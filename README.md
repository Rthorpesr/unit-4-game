Crystals Collector's Game
Written by: Reginald D. Thorpe
When: June 2019

This program was written during my second week in the George Washington Univerisity' Coding BootCamp.

Purpose: The assignment was to build a game called the "Crystal Collector.

Game instructions:
                   The player will be given a random number at the start of the game. That number will appear on the screen in the
                   first box below the instructions. 
                   
                   There are four crystals below the random number displaying. The play is to click on a crystal tha
                    will add a specific amount of points to your total score. 
             
                    The player wins the game by matching his/her total score to random number
                    The player loses the game if their total score goes above the radom number.
                             
                    The value of each crystal is hidden from the player until it is clicked on.
 
                    Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
